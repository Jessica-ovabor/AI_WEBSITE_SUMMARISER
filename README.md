# AI Website Summarizer

## Project Description

This project uses **Selenium** to scrape the content of any website. The scraper is dynamic, allowing it to handle different types of pages. The scraped content is then summarized using a **large language model (LLM)** from **OpenRouterAI**.

## Setup and Installation

This project uses the **uv** tool instead of the traditional `pip` for managing Python packages.

### Steps:

1. **Ensure uv is installed** (via pip):

```powershell
pip install uv
```

2. **Clone the repository**:

```powershell
git clone "https://github.com/Jessica-ovabor/AI_WEBSITE_SUMMARISER.git"
```

3. **Install dependencies**:

```powershell
uv sync
```

### Optional Notes:

* Make sure your **browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox)** is installed for Selenium to work.
* Always use the **uv environment** when running scripts to avoid conflicts.
